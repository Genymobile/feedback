Wish to help us improve our products? Feel free to [make a suggestion](#making-suggestions) to share your ideas and feedback here!

Discussion categories have been established for specific products; topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the general category.

Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/Genymobile/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions to help us improve our products and user experience. 

Open a discussion in the category specific to your feedback and we'll review your suggestions. The community will also be able to react to your submission.

Please keep in mind that this area is for feedback and suggestions only; it is not suitable for technical support requests.

Your feedback is very important to us as it helps us to prioritize our roadmap.

Don't forget to take a look at previous discussions: someone may have already posted on a similar topic. If so, you can reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to let know of your support, rather than creating a new discussion.

### From suggestion to shipped feature

Once you start a discussion, the Genymotion product team will evaluate your feedback. However, we cannot respond to every submission:

- Either we decide to prioritize your idea and will keep you informed.
- Or we decide to not prioritize it and may comment on the discussion.
