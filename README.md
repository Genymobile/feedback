Have ideas or feedback for how we can further improve our products? This place is where you can share them or react to existing ones. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

Discussion categories have been established for specific products. Topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the general category. Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/Genymobile/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. 

Open a discussion in the category specific to your feedback and we'll review your suggestions, the community will also react to your submission.

Please keep in mind that this area is for feedback only. Your feedback is very important to us as it helps us to prioritize our roadmap.

Don't forget to take a look at previous discussions to see if someone already submitted your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the Genymotion product team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission.

- Either we decide to prioritize your idea and so we will keep you informed.
- Or we decide to not prioritize it and we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning.
